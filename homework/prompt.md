## ðŸŽ¯ Ongoing Practice Assignments

### Weekly Challenge: Prompt Debugging
**Format:** Students get "broken" prompts that produce poor results

**Common Issues to Debug:**
- **Hallucination:** Prompt that creates fake clinical data
- **Format Issues:** Inconsistent or unusable output structure
- **Context Problems:** Missing critical business context
- **Edge Cases:** Prompt fails with unusual inputs
- **Scope Creep:** Prompt tries to do too many things

**Example Broken Prompt:**
```
"Analyze this drug and tell me everything about it and what will happen in the market and if it's good or bad and what companies should do about it."
```

**Task:** Diagnose issues and fix the prompts
